## Favorite CPSC120L Labs

Lab 7, part 2 

Lab 7 part two was one of my personal favorites because it showed us how to use if-statements in a way that is a real world problem and how to use them as a solution. I enjoyed this lab because it showed us a way to categorize something in our own school using programming to make things more efficient. I was having a hard time trying to find real life applications and how to use computer science surrounding these applications and this lab really opened up a lot of ideas and showed me real applications of computer science that could be used.

Lab 5, part 2 

Lab 5 part two was also another one of my favorites. My reason being for this was because of how I can definitely use this program day to day and how many companies already do this conversion. When you type ounces to cups google pops up the conversion right away. This is basically the same thing we did and it was very interesting to see the actual code that goes into it. I can't recall how many times ive had to look up this conversion for cooking things in my house.

Lab 8, part 1 

Lab 8 part 1 was a favorite of my mind because of its applications. The sandwich sorting madlib shows that this simple code can be used in a number of ways. Such as in video games when you enter your name then you see it throughout texts, a character would say “Hello, your name” this is the same scenario with the sandwiches just with a different application with having set texts with user input.
